# S-ReactENV 
### Sein's React Environment Boilerplate

S-ReactENV is a reference guide to build a boilerplate of minimalistic React Environment from scratch by using generic React, React-DOM, Webpack 4 and Babel.

## Pre-requisites
We require npm and node pre-installed on our machine before we dive into the project. If you already have npm and node pre-installed before, you can skip to Getting Started.
```sh
$ brew install node
$ npm install npm@latest -g
```

Run the following code, if npm is asking permission/ownership
```sh
$ sudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP ~/.npm
$ sudo chown -R $USER:$GROUP ~/.config
```
